=head1 NAME

CSS::Coverage - Confirm that your CSS matches your DOM

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    css-coverage style.css index.html second.html
        Unmatched selectors (3):
            div.form-actions button:first-child
            .expanded span.open
            ul.attn li form textarea


    my $coverage = CSS::Coverage->new(
        css       => $css_file,
        documents => \@html_files,
    );

    my $report = $coverage->check;

    print for $report->unmatched_selectors;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Every CSS rule in your stylesheets have a cost. Browser must parse
them and apply them to your document. Your maintainers have to understand what each rule is doing. If a CSS rule doesn't appear to match any part of the document, maintainers wonder "is that intentional, or just a typo?"

So it is useful excise unused CSS rules. Unfortunately it is very
tedious to manually confirm whether a particular CSS selector matches
any of your documents. There are browser-based tools, like one that
ships in Chrome, that do this for you. However, they do not presently
check multiple pages. Browser tools are also not great for running
in a continuous integration environment.

This module and its associated C<css-coverage> script provide a
good first stab at paring down the list of rules to manually check.

=head2 JavaScript

Modern HTML pages are living, breathing, dynamic documents.
CSS::Coverage can only I<statically> check whether a CSS selector
matches an HTML document. So if you manipulate the DOM in JavaScript,
CSS::Coverage may report false positives. There's certainly a point
where CSS::Coverage provides diminishing returns if your page is
very JavaScript-heavy. But for static, or mostly-static, pages,
CSS::Coverage should be useful.

If you know that a particular rule only matches when JavaScript
runs, you can add a comment like this either inside or before that
CSS rule:

    a.clicked {
        /* coverage: dynamic */
        text-decoration: line-through;
    }

    /* coverage: dynamic */
    a.clicked {
        text-decoration: line-through;
    }

Either directive will cause CSS::Coverage to skip that rule entirely.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 css (Str|ScalarRef)

If given a string, C<css> is treated as a filename. If given as a scalar reference, C<css> is treated as CSS code.

=head2 documents (ArrayRef[Str|ScalarRef])

A list of HTML documents. For each document, strings are treated as filenames; scalar reference as raw HTML code.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 check

Runs a coverage check of the given CSS against the given documents. Returns a L<CSS::Coverage::Report> object.
